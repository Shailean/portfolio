# Financial Literacy Game
In this project, I had to create a game to show proficiency in Python conditionals.

## Project Requirements
1.  Descriptions are printed to the console for the player to see.

2. The `time.sleep` function is used to create delays between messages so that they aren't all printed at once.

3. The `random.choice` or `random.randint` function is used to influence the game so that each game is different in some way.

4. The `input` function is used to ask the player what they would like to do. The player's choices affect what happens in the game.

5. If the player enters a choice that is not valid, the game gives them the chance to retry until they enter a valid option. The game does not crash and does not treat invalid input as a valid choice.

6. The code includes at least four function definitions that are used to improve the code in some way, such as by: 
    - Reducing repetition, 
    - Reducing complexity, 
    - Improving the readability or organization of the code
    <br><br>
7. The `pycodestyle` tool reports zero errors and zero warnings.

8. The program is a playable game, and runs from start to finish without crashing or displaying errors.
