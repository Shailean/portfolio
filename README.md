# About Me
I spent the first 10+ years of my career working at nonprofit organizations with over 6 of those years as a financial literacy educator. Lately, I've developed an interest in how technological interventions can have a beneficial impact on marginalized populations and so I'm looking to transition into tech. I have been taking courses on freeCodeCamp, Udemy, and Codecademy to build my skill set in Web Development and UX Design. 

I graduated from [Generation USA](https://usa.generation.org/)'s Junior Web Developer bootcamp in September 2022.

I am currently enrolled (as of October 19, 2022) in [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044)'s Full Stack Developer bootcamp (as a scholarship recipient sponsored by Cognizant) with a graduation date of March 2023.

## About My Portfolio
I attended Generation USA's Junior Web Developer bootcamp from May 2022 to September 2022 where I worked on a **To Do List (Task Manager) app** group project. I was responsible for creating the wireframe, CSS, and an error message (when a required field is left blank) using JavaScript.

In Udacity's Full Stack Developer bootcamp I completed the following projects so far:

- **Animal Trading Card**: using HTML, CSS, and a design prototype I was asked to show understanding of how to utilize classes in HTML in order to apply styling to elements in CSS. This project showcases my ability to utilize proper syntax to create a visually appealing design.
