# About Me
I spent the first 10+ years of my career working at nonprofit organizations with over 6 of those years as a financial literacy educator. Lately, I've developed an interest in how technological interventions can have a beneficial impact on marginalized populations and so I'm looking to incorporate tech into my personal finance experience. I have been taking courses on freeCodeCamp, Udemy, and Codecademy to build my skill set in Web Development and UX Design. 

I graduated from [Generation USA](https://usa.generation.org/)'s Junior Web Developer bootcamp in September 2022.

I am currently enrolled (as of October 19, 2022) in [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com/course/full-stack-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0044)'s Full Stack Developer bootcamp (as a scholarship recipient sponsored by Cognizant) with a graduation date of March 2023.

## Tech Stack

## About My Portfolio
My portfolio is a work in progress that I will be updating periodically as I complete personal and bootcamp projects.

**Personal Projects**

- **[Detangle Your Money](https://github.com/Shailean/detangle-your-money)**: Website for a financial coaching service. I built this project to practice UI design, content design, and making websites responsive for mobile screens.

**Bootcamp Projects**

In Udacity's Full Stack Developer bootcamp I completed the following projects so far:

- **[Animal Trading Card](https://github.com/Shailean/portfolio/tree/main/school-projects/1-animal-trading-card)**: using HTML, CSS, and a design prototype I was asked to show understanding of how to utilize classes in HTML in order to apply styling to elements in CSS. This project showcases my ability to utilize proper syntax to create a visually appealing design.

- **[Financial Literacy Game](https://github.com/Shailean/portfolio/tree/main/school-projects/2-financial-lit-mortgages)**: using Python, I created a game that explains the mortgage application process that banks use to assess an individual's application for a home loan.
