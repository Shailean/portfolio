                <p>Your payment history accounts for 35% of your credit score. Your payment history tells the creditor how often you pay: on-time, late, or miss a payment. Late and missed payments have the biggest negative impact on your credit score.</p>

                <p class="code"><code>Jordan has a credit score of 720. She wants to purchase a home in 6 months. Three months before her home purchase she goes to her bank to get a mortgage pre-approval but is denied because her score has fallen to 560. When Jordan checks her credit score she sees a $30 collection from her old cable company.
                <br><br>
                Upon calling to enquire about the collection she is told that she failed to return her cable equipment. She promptly makes the $30 payment she owes but her score will not improve for some time because late payments stay on your credit report for 7 years.</code></p>

                <!--User Story #5-->
                <p>Your credit utilization accounts for 30% of your credit score. Credit utilization tells creditors how much of your available credit you are currently using (basically, the balances of your credit cards as a percentage of your total credit limit). </p>
        
                <!--User Story #6-->
                <p class="code"><code>You may calculate your credit utilization by dividing the total balance of your credit cards by the total credit limit of your credit cards. </code></p>

                        <br>
                        <li>Carrying a balance on your credit cards from month to month only results in you having to pay interest to the credit card company. If you maintain a zero balance by paying off your credit cards in full every month you will not be charged interest.</li>

                <p>The length of your credit history pertains to the amount of time you have had credit available to you and accounts for 15% of your credit score. Creditors look at the age of your oldest and newest account along with the average age of all your accounts.</p>

                <p class="code"><code>Toni grew up with parents who were always in credit card debt because they would max out their credit cards and struggle to make the payments. Toni is afraid of the temptation to spend money she doesn't have and so she has avoided applying for credit cards and instead only uses cash.
                <br><br>
                Toni wants to purchase a home in the next 3 years but when she met with a representative of her bank she was told that she wouldn't be approved for a mortgage. Since she has never applied for credit cards or loans she has no credit history for the bank to check to see if she would be a good candidate for a mortgage.

                    <ul>
                        <li>In order to have a credit score you need to have open credit accounts (credit cards and/or loans). Try not to close your oldest accounts or allow them to become inactive. Your oldest accounts carry most of your credit history.</li>

                <!--User Story #5-->
                <p>New credit makes up 10% of your credit score. When you apply for credit cards and loans each application is added to your credit file as a credit inquiry and has a minimal negative impact on your score. Credit inquiries remain on your credit report for 2 years.</p>
                <!--User Story #6-->
                <p class="code"><code>Depending on the line of credit you're in the market for you may need to incur multiple credit inquiries in a short period of time. For example: It is always best practice to shop around for the best mortgage rates so applying for multiple mortgage pre-approvals will be necessary. The slight drop in your credit score will be worth securing a lower interest rate.</code></p>

                        <li>Creditors will negatively view numerous credit inquiries in a short period of time. Avoid applying for and opening too many lines of credit within a 12 month period.

                <p>Credit mix also makes up 10% of your credit score. Credit mix refers to the types of credit on your credit report. There are 2 main types of credit: revolving (credit cards) and installment (loans).</p>
                <!--User Story #6-->
                <p class="code"><code>The revolving nature of credit cards means they can remain open and active for as long as you want. However, istallment accounts like student loans, auto loans, mortgages, etc will eventually be paid off. Once these loans are closed they will no longer have an impact on your credit score and you may experience a slight drop in your score.</code></p>
