# Animal Trading Cards
In this project, I had to demonstrate HTML and CSS skills by re-creating a webpage from a design prototype.

<br>

## Project Requirements
1. Customize the starter page with content about the chosen animal

2. The image should have a width of 300 pixels

3. Fully separate all of the style information from the HTML

4. The card's width should be fixed

5. The entire card's width should be 300px + spacing on each side

6. The text for the animal's interesting facts should be in italics

7. The labels for each of the animal's list items should be bold

8. There should be no bullet points for the list items

9. There should be borders around the animal name, image, and text information

10. There should be padding around the animal's, name, image, list of items, and information
